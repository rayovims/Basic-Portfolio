                <p>My name is Raymundo Ojeda and I am currently studying computer science at the university of Montclair state. I have love technology since I was a little boy and 19 yeas later here I am, doing what I have always wanted todo. This bootcamp has already taught me so many things that I had never pictured I would be doing (or at least I thought)! Seeing that it's only been two weeks I can't imagine what I'll be doing when I finish it!
                    <br>
                    <br> I decided to take this bootcamp as a chance to increase my knowledge in a very short amount of time. I have been waiting for a challange seeing that college has not been all I thought it would be. However I go back to school on the fifth of September and this is where the challenge will begin. I want to have some type of background information before I begin my mayor and this is exactly what I need!
